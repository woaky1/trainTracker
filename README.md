# trainTracker

This is a project I created as part of my studies at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. The page takes in train data and stores it in Firebase. We then can access that Firebase information to display information in a train time table. Since the data is stored in Firebase, multiple users can see and add information to the page at the same time. The page also features time until next train and next train to arrive data that updates automatically every minute.
